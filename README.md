# Statista Coding Challenge

This repository contains the solution to the coding challenge for Statista. The challenge consists of building a simple web application that allows users to search, view and bookmark entries from a provided sample JSON file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/lcwalther/statista-coding-challenge.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173. The app will start with a search page, where you can search entries from the provided sample JSON file and bookmark them for later view. Due to the sample file limitation, results will only be shown when entering the search term "Statista".

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- An internet connection to load the sample JSON file, as well as fonts and some icons.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed by running `npm run dev` in the terminal after installing the dependencies.

## Built With

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- react-query
- Vite
